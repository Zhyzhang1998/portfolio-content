                My landscape design is focusing on human, it's about human's past, present, and future. I try different materials and different space design, all this are going to create a better feeling for people, as well as the living environment. Also, as UX designer, my design is user-centered, and also driven by data. I collected and investigated different sets of spatial scale to find out the most suitable one for the users. And analyzed the soil types, wind direction, sun shade and other contextual information of the site. All these data drives me to a better built environment design for human.

                This is a rendered model for my design. It shows the spatial scale of my design for a people, and the relationship between design and site itself. This is made by Rhino and V-ray. This project is intended to remind people of the miserable happens during the World War 2 in Nanjing city. I try to create linear and variable space to make the tourists share the despair feeling of comfort women during the war, and let them cherish the precious peace. For the model view, we can see the sequence clearly. Tourists can feel the depression brought by war. The atmosphere here is heavy.
