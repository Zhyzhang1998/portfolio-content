            This project focuses on the future tense of Poyang Lake's environment. I assume that the Cyanobacteria will outbreak in the future. Due to other severe ecological issues, like sandmining, heavy fishing and farmland reclamation, the birds here is also decreasing. I try to use a kind of installation to restore the environment and improve the revenue of the residents.

            I mainly choose the Poyang Lake local vegetation to improve the environments. Apart from that we also consider the the economic effect the vegetation can provide. So I choose the reed to provide the farmers fiber for selling. I choose the water hyacinth to use it to absorb the extra nitrogen and it can also be collected for the feed of livestock. I choose the specific kinds of fish to eliminate the Cyanobacteria, at the same time, this fish can both be the food of bird and the revenue of the residents.
