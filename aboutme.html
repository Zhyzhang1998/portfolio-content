                Hi, my name is Zhongyi Zhang. I'm from Suzhou, China. I was a landscape architect. I spent a year to do some landscape designs in China. Suzhou is a city renowned for its rapid technological development and its eye-catching canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens, I was taken aback by the scenery and history surrounding the city’s iconic gardens. And now I am currently a student at the University of Michigan School of Information, pursing a Master's degree in User Experience and Human Computer Interaction. I want to be a font-end engineer or UX designer in the future. I believe technology and information combined with art design may help people enhance the living environment.

                I love taking photos, this was taken in Glacier National Park in 2016. And because of my landscape architect background, I'm interested in Chinese Historic buildings, especially pavilions. And I made a model of Yuquansi Tongtian pavilion. This model is a combination of modern technology (3D printing) and ancient Chinese timber architecture. I believe we can try to use modern tool to revitalize traditional culture. And that’s what I’m trying to focus on now. I also know drawing and calligraphy. Watercolor and photography are excellent tools to express my feeling of the colorful world. The passion for the world drives me to create more Landscape architecture design projects.
